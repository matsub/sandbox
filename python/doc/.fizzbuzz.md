# The `fizzbuzz` module

This is the trace of experience that I studied how to create the documentation.
I wrote Fizzbuzz as usual.


## Modules

This module for providing fizzbuzz. First import `fizzbuzz`:

    >>> import fizzbuzz


### Using `fizzbuzz.fizzbuzz(n)` function

Return a *\<generator>* that counts incrementally from 1 to `n`, replacing any
number divisible by three with the word "fizz" and any number divisible by five
with the word "buzz". Type of `n` must be a positive *\<int>*.

    >>> for called in fizzbuzz.fizzbuzz():
    ...     print(called)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: fizzbuzz() missing 1 required positional argument: 'n'
    >>> 
    >>> for called in fizzbuzz.fizzbuzz(1, 2):
